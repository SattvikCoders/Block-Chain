The development and implementation of a blockchainbased athlete management system represent a transformative approach to dealing with longstanding
challenges of data fragmentation, inefficiency, and a lack of transparency in athlete lifecycle management. By carefully leveraging the special capabilities of
blockchain technology—including decentralization, immutability, along with smart contracts—this particular system offers a decidedly strong solution. In addition to
that, it serves to completely unify data throughput across the entire athlete lifecycle, spanning from initial recruitment and training to precise performance
tracking as well as eventual retirement.
